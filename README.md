## About
The objeective of this is to join Developers who known how to program in ASM to make a lightweight Shell-Like OS, that's able to load scripts and install packages.
<br><br> But really, it's just a sketch for a future project. To make it really simple for developers, the boot folder (In UEFI Platforms) has the boot.efi, wich directly loads the shell and the background programs.
<br> Legacy BIOS Support isn't planned.
